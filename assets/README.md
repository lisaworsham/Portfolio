# 2: Responsive Portfolio

The goal was to make a website for my web development portfolio using Bootstrap and to have it on a repository so it can be updated and pushed to the respository throughout the bootcamp. There are 3 pages: Home/About to provide information about me, Portfolio with links to all work, and Contact which is a form to allow people who want to contact me may do so there.

## Prerequisites

```
Used Visual Studio Code, Bootstrap and chrome's inspector tool to help build and rework code. 
```

## Process/What was Changed

```
First, I researched other web developer's website and pulled some ideas that I could incorperate into my own website while still following the guidelines provided making sure I was pulling the responsive script from Bootstrap. I sketched my design in my notebook and figured out my grid so I knew how many rows and columns I would need.

Then I started my code with Bootstrap by pulling their HTML framework code and making sure I had my reset CSS style sheet and my main CSS style sheet.

I looked for my components that I need, copied and pasted them in my html. My navbar was where I began my styling process and worked my way down. Inputing my html and then adding CSS styling. Once my index.html was finished, I copied and pasted the code into 2 new html files called portfolio.html & contact.html. Reworked the <container> contents so they showed the corresponding content for each html file. 

Next, was making sure my website was responsive, which it was and I noticed some styling changes that I could make to the CSS which was padding and resizing my images.

## Review

Taking the first step for this was the hardest for me. There was alot to do and several thoughts where being tossed around in my head. And then I remembered the instructor saying the best place to start is drawing it out. I took my pencil and my graph paper notebook, and worked out my website and how I was invisioning it. Graph paper was a HUGE help because it was already a grid. After that, things started to click and I worked my way through my process above. 

Websites take time. Even simple ones like this. You have to set a timeline and keep to a schedule. When I got frustrated with code that wasn't working, I took a break and stepped  away. I would still think about it in my head and try to work it out. When I would get an epiphiney, I'd come back and fix my problem. 

It's not exactly the way I want it but that's because I haven't quite learned everything yet. But I reminded myself that I'll be updating this as I go along over the next few months. As with all websites.
